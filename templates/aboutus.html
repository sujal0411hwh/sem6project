        <h2>Technologies Used in CKPCET Chatbot</h2>
        <p>
            The CKPCET Chatbot leverages a combination of modern web technologies to deliver a seamless and efficient user experience. Below are the key technologies used in building the chatbot:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>JavaScript:</strong> The chatbot is implemented using JavaScript, which handles user input, event-driven interactions, and dynamic updates of the chat interface. It powers the chatbot's logic and intent matching.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>HTML:</strong> HTML provides the structural foundation for the chatbot’s user interface, defining the layout, input field, and message display area.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>CSS:</strong> CSS enhances the chatbot’s interface by styling user and bot messages, aligning elements, and creating an appealing visual design.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Local storage is used to store frequently asked questions (FAQs) and dynamically add new ones based on user interactions. FAQs persist even after the page is refreshed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Intent Matching and Synonym Mapping:</strong> The chatbot uses predefined sets of synonyms to map user input to intents, enabling it to understand the context of queries even if phrased differently.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Question Frequency Tracking:</strong> Tracks how often specific questions are asked by users. Once a predefined threshold is met, those questions are dynamically added to the FAQ dataset.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stopword Removal:</strong> Improves input processing by removing irrelevant words like "what," "is," or "the," making it easier to match queries to responses.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Timeout for Simulating Bot Thinking:</strong> Introduces a slight delay before displaying responses using the <code>setTimeout()</code> function, simulating human-like thinking behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>JSON Dataset:</strong> Stores predefined question-and-answer pairs, serving as the chatbot's knowledge base. This dataset is also dynamically updated with new FAQs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Browser-Based Implementation:</strong> The chatbot is entirely browser-based, running on the client side without requiring a server, ensuring it is lightweight and easily deployable.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These technologies work seamlessly together to make CKPCET Chatbot a lightweight, efficient, and user-friendly solution for campus-related queries.
